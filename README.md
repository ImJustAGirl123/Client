This is a cracked version of the PolarClient ChatTriggers Module, how this works is you need to install a mod called ChatTriggers from https://www.chattriggers.com/ (make sure its the latest version 2.2.1+).

After installing ChatTriggers into your mods folder 1.8.9 close your Minecraft account and go to 

https://github.com/ChatTriggers/ChatTriggers/wiki/Fixing-broken-imports

press on the blue highlighted windows text, it will start a installing for a specific version of java and set that up.

once its fully installed open your Minecraft launcher and press on Installations press the three dots on the side of the
installation of Minecraft you are trying to run polar on, press more options and you will see a line called java executable,

empty the field and paste in the follow text,

C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jre-8.0.372.7-hotspot\bin\javaw.exe

Press save then run Minecraft, load into Hypixel or a single player world and type the following commands in order.

/ct load /ct reload.

Then the final steps enter the command /ct files and it will open up file explorer in the chat triggers config,
open up modules folder and paste in the PolarClient folder from the release tab.

do /ct load and /ct reload again then /polar to open up the gui.

Issues,
Make sure to PolarClient folder Isn't zipped.
Make sure your forge is installed properly.
If it says unknown command on /polar make sure you follow the fix properly.
Any more issues and dm dextermorgan69_ for support.
